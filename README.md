# android.github.shopify

A demostration app with a single recycler view, displaying public repositories for the ShopifyÂ organisation using the Github Developer API.

The recycler view displays the following information:

* Name
* If it is a fork or not (Y/N)
* Number of stargazers
* Time since it was created
* An interaction on the row which opens the user's browser to the repository's page

Goals:

* Solve the problem using Android (Kotlin preferred)
* Retrofit
* Back the recycler view with some type of cache or persistence layer
* Use an architecture pattern

# Architecture Pattern

The architectural pattern chosen was Model-View-Presenter (MVP) as a balance between separation of concerns, existing knowledge and speed to a minimum viable product.

# Libraries

3rd party libraries:

* okhttp
* retrofit
* joda-time

Google:

* gson
* recyclerview
* room

# To Do

* Rx - too much work is being done on the UI thread leading to some UI jank on the emulator when loading items
* Dagger - at the moment injection is handled by an object that can be override for unit tests via product flavours
* Clean - implement use cases and separate layers into data / domain / presentation
* Unit tests
* Developed for Pixel 2 API 27 - test for more devices / screen sizes / API levels
