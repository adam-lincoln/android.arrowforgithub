The recycler view displays the following information:

* Name
* If it is a fork or not (Y/N)
* Number of stargazers
* Time since it was created
* An interaction on the row which opens the user's browser to the repository's page

Additional goals:

* Solve the problem using Android (Kotlin preferred)
* Retrofit
* Back the recycler view with some type of cache or persistence layer
* Architecture pattern

# Architecture Pattern

The architectural pattern chosen was Model-View-Presenter (MVP) as a balance between existing knowledge and speed to a minimum viable product.

# Libraries

3rd party libraries:

* okhttp
* retrofit
* joda-time

Google:
