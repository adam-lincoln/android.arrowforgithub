# android.github.shopify

Please create an app that has a single table/recycler view, which displays public repositories for the Shopify organisation using the Github Developer API.

In the table/recycler view we want to see the following information:

• Name
• If it is a fork or not (Y/N)
• Number of stargazers
• Time since it was created. Come up with a format that is readable
• An interaction on the row which opens the user's browser to the repository's page

Goals:

* Solve the problem using Android (Kotlin preferred)
* Retrofit
* Back the recycler view with some type of cache or persistence layer
* Architecture pattern
